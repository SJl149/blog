I am an Automation Engineer at an EdTech non-profit, father of two, fluent speaker of Chinese, and an avid cyclist. After spending 12 years living, teaching, and studying language in Korea and China, I have settled in New York City. Software testing and devlopment is not just my job, it is my passion. Have an idea or an opportunity? Let me know how I can help!
